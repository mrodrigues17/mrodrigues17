### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a data analyst at Claro Healthcare (a healthcare consulting firm) and recently finished DePaul's MS in Data Science Program.

My undergraduate degree was in finance, but I gained an interest in statistics and data science in early 2017. I have two years experience working in a financial services firm managing expenses, two years of experience in research assistant roles, and have worked as an analyst for Claro Healthcare since March 2018.

Please see the projects tab above if you would like to view some of the projects I've worked on, or the courses tab to view some of my school-related projects.
